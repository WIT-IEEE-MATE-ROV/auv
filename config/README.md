This is a directory to contain configuration files. If a configuration file needs to exist, 
it should be placed in here rather than cluttering up some other directory.

In the case of some of these files, they are simply python files. These files can then be imported at runtime to set
variables, avoiding the need for file parsing that can get a bit messy.
