# AUV User's Manual
## Setup
_start here!_
To set up the AUV, you'll need all the [hardware](https://github.com/enbarr/hardware) set up if you plan on running this not in simulation. If you only want to do this in simulation or you aready have the hardware, start [here](https://github.com/enbarr/auv/blob/master/docs/setup.md) to either set up your PC as a development environment, surface station, or the AUV itself.

## API
The API is how you'll build on top of the Enbarr architecture. Read an overview [here](https://github.com/enbarr/auv/blob/master/docs/api.md), or check out the following topics:
